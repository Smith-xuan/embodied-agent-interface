# Subgoal Decomposition

## Description

The **Subgoal Decomposition** module takes the task $\langle s_0, g\rangle$ as input, where:

+ $s_0$ represents the initial state of the environment
+ $g$ is the task goal

Similar to **Action Sequencing** module, **Subgoal Decomposition** also takes a transition model $\mathcal{M}$ as input specific to the simulator, which describes the transition between two consecutive states when an action is implemented. For more details on the transition model, refer to:

- `src/behavior_eval/evolving_graph/evolving_graph.py` for `Behavior`
- `src/virtualhome_eval/simulation/evolving_graph/environment.py` for `VirtualHome`

The module generates a subgoal trajectory $\bar{\phi}=\{\phi_i\}_{i=1}^m$ specific to the final goal $g$, where each $\phi_i$ is a subgoal and listed in temporal order. Our `embodied agent interface` uses BFS algorithm to search possible action lists to satisfy each subgoal $\phi_i$, which then can validated by simulator through action sequence execution.

## Evaluation Details

### Evaluation Prerequisites

It is challenging to actually evaluate a generated subgoal trajectory itself, as

1. There is no referenced subgoal annotation available as ground truth
2. There are always multiple ways to achieve a task goal. For example, in the task `wash clothes`, the agent can either wash with hands, or wash with a washing machine.

One way to evaluate subgoal trajectories generated by planners like LLMs is transforming then into executable sequences, which requires us:

1. Define a structured symbolic representation for subgoal trajectories for easy translation into actions;
2. Implement a translation layer to transform existing subgoal trajectories into legal action sequences.

To resolve these challenges, we implement a customized **L**inear **T**emporal **L**ogic (**LTL**), and uses **BFS algorithm** to help us translate the subgoal trajectories into action sequences with some heuristics.

#### LTL Implementation

Please refer `behavior_eval.tl_formula.simple_tl` and `behavior_eval.tl_formula.simple_tl_parser` for further details about LTL.

#### BFS Algorithm Implementation

We incorporate some heuristics into our BFS algorithm. In the following, we will briefly introduce how they are implemented in our simulators.

##### BEHAVIOR

In **BEHAVIOR** simulator, we implement the translation part in `behavior_eval.evaluation.subgoal_decomposition.state_action_translator.py`. For your better understanding, here is an example of translating state `ontop` into actions that can lead to it:
```python 
elif primitive_name == 'ontop' or primitive_name == 'onfloor':
  receivee = predicate.args[0]
  receiver = predicate.args[1]
  common_action_list = []
  hand_holding = self.check_in_which_hand(receivee, cur_hand_state)
  if hand_holding is None:
      hand_holding, grasp_actions_list = self.grasp_obj(cur_hand_state, receivee, None)
      common_action_list.extend(grasp_actions_list)
  ontop_args = [receiver]

  action_set_1 = copy.deepcopy(common_action_list)
  place_ontop_str = f'<hand>_PLACE_ONTOP'
  place_ontop = self.craft_an_action(place_ontop_str, ontop_args, hand_holding)
  action_set_1.append(place_ontop)

  action_set_2 = copy.deepcopy(common_action_list)
  transfer_str = f'<hand>_TRANSFER_CONTENTS_ONTOP'
  transfer = self.craft_an_action(transfer_str, ontop_args, hand_holding)
  action_set_2.append(transfer)

  action_set_candidates.append(action_set_1)
```

Here, we can see that either `PLACE_ONTOP` action or `TRANSFER_CONETENTS_ONTOP` action can lead to `ontop` state after the action is executed. So we have two action lists.

##### VirtualHome

In **VirtualHome** simulator, we implement the translation part in `virtualhome_eval.evaluation.subgoal_decomposition.state_action_translator.py`. For your better understanding, here is an example of translating the subgoal `CLEAN` state into action list candidates that can lead to this state:

```python
elif primitive_name == 'CLEAN':
  find_item = self.translate_single_action('FIND', obj_name, obj_id)
  common_action_set.append(find_item)
  ans_set_1 = copy.deepcopy(common_action_set)
  ans_set_2 = copy.deepcopy(common_action_set)
  wipe_item = self.translate_single_action('WIPE', obj_name, obj_id)
  ans_set_1.append(wipe_item)
  wash_item = self.translate_single_action('WASH', obj_name, obj_id)
  ans_set_2.append(wash_item)
  action_set_candidates.append(ans_set_1)
  action_set_candidates.append(ans_set_2)
```

Here, we can see that actions like `WIPE` and `WASH` can transition the state to `CLEAN`. Therefore, we have two action candidates (each is a small action list) for further searching.

As each subgoal coresponds to one or more action list candidates and all subgoals are listed in terms of temporal order, we can now perform a BFS algorithm by executing all possible (with a pruning) combinitions in the simulator. 

###  Evaluation Workflow

#### Success Definition

The subgoal will be recognized as executable as long as it has at least one action sequence translation; while it will be recognized as a success as long as it has at least one action sequence translation that satisfies the task goal after execution.

#### Workflow

We consider all possible action sequences $\mathcal{A}=\{a_j\}^m$ for a subgoal trajectory $\bar{\phi}$ The evaluation of the subgoal decomposition involves two parts:

1. **Trajectory Evaluation**
   + **Purpose:** To determine whether there is at least one of the translated action sequences $\hat{a}\in\mathcal{A}$ is executable in the simulator.
   + **Process: ** Execute $\hat{a}$ to obtain the trajectory $T = ⟨\{s_i\}_{i=0}^{m}, \{a_i\}_{i=1}^{m}⟩$.
   + **Outcome**: If an infeasible action occurs, execution may stop early. Execution failures are categorized into:
     - **Missing Steps**: Necessary actions that were omitted.
     - **Additional Steps**: Unnecessary actions that were included.
     - **Wrong Temporal Order**: Actions executed in an incorrect sequence.
     - **Affordance Errors**: Actions incompatible with the current state of objects (e.g., trying to "open" an object that cannot be opened).
   + **Best Selection: ** Iterate all $\hat{a}\in\mathcal{A}$. If all fail, select one with the minimum errors in total for statistics calculation (E.g., for a subgoal trajectory $\bar{\phi}_0$, say it has two trajectories $a_1$ andn $a_2$. If $a_1$ has 1 error, and $a_2$ has 3 errors, then we only use $a_1$ to represent $\bar{\phi}_0$).
2. **Goal Evaluation**:
   - **Purpose**: To assess if the task goal $g$ is satisfied after executing $\hat{a}\in\mathcal{A}$.
   - **Process**: Check for goal satisfaction, e.g. `behavior_eval.evolving_graph.evolving_graph.check_success`.
   - **Partial Goal Satisfaction Evaluation**:
     - Measures the percentage of subgoals in $g$ that are satisfied by $\bar{a}$.
     - **Process**:
       - Decompose $g$ into simple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) goals $g_i$.
       - For each $g_i$:
         - Let $g_i = a₁ \overset{\text{then}}{\ldots} aₖ \textbf{~then~} (p₁ \land \ldots \land p_\ell)$.
         - Check if a subsequence in $\bar{a}$ matches $\{a_j\}_{j=1}^k$.
         - Evaluate the final state propositions $p_j$ in $s_m$.
       - Assign partial credits based on the number of propositions satisfied.
     - **Final Metric**: $\textit{PartialSucc}(\hat{a}, g) = \max_{g_i \in \mathcal{G}(g, \mathcal{U})} \textit{PartialSucc}(\hat{a}, g_i)$.
   - **Best Selection: ** Iterate all executable $\hat{a}\in\mathcal{A}$, select successful ones, or select the one that is closest to achieve $g$ for statistics.

### Metrics

The evaluation metrics are divided into two categories:

1. **Trajectory Metrics**:
   - **Execution Success Rate**: The proportion of actions in $\hat{a}$ executed successfully without errors.
   - **Error Rates**:
     - **Parsing Errors**: Issues in interpreting the action sequence.
     - **Hallucination Errors**: Actions involving objects or states not present in the environment.
     - **Argument Errors**: Incorrect arguments provided for actions.
     - **Missing Steps**: Rate of necessary actions that were omitted.
     - **Additional Steps**: Rate of unnecessary actions included.
     - **Wrong Temporal Order**: Rate of actions executed in an incorrect sequence.
     - **Affordance Errors**: Rate of actions that cannot be performed due to object states.

2. **Goal Metrics**:
   - **Task Success Rate**: The proportion of tasks where the goal $g$ is fully satisfied after executing $\hat{a}$.
   - **Partial Goal Satisfaction Evaluation**:
     - **State Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying state-based goals (e.g., object states).
     - **Relation Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying relation-based goals (e.g., object relationships).
     - **Action Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for achieving the specified action sequence.
     - **Total Goal Satisfaction**: Overall goal achievement rate, combining state, relation, and action goals.

### Output

The evaluation process produces several outputs:

- **Execution Information**:
  - Details for each action in $\bar{a}$, indicating whether it was executed successfully.
  - Error types encountered during execution (if any).
  - Step-by-step execution status.

    - **Action Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for achieving the specified action sequence.
    - **Total Goal Satisfaction**: Combined success rate across all goal types.
  - **Trajectory Evaluation**:
    - **Execution Success Rate**: Overall success rate of the action sequence execution.
