# Action Sequencing

## Description

The **action sequencing** module takes the task ⟨$s_0$, $g$⟩ as input, where:

- **$s_0$** represents the initial state of the environment.
- **$g$** is the task goal.

The module uses a transition model $\mathcal{M}$ specific to the simulator, which governs how the environment evolves based on actions. For more details on the transition model, refer to:

- `src/behavior_eval/evolving_graph/evolving_graph.py` for `Behavior`
- `src/virtualhome_eval/simulation/evolving_graph/environment.py` for `VirtualHome`

The module generates an action sequence $\bar{a} = \{a_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$, representing the actions required to move from the initial state toward achieving the task goal.

## Evaluation Details

### Evaluation Workflow

The evaluation of the action sequencing module involves two main components:

1. **Trajectory Evaluation**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine whether the generated action sequence $\bar{a}$ is executable in the simulator.
   - **Process**: Execute $\bar{a}$ to obtain the trajectory $T = ⟨\{s_i\}_{i=0}^{m}, \{a_i\}_{i=1}^{m}⟩$, e.g. `behavior_eval.evolving_graph.eval_evolving_graph_env.apply_action`.
   - **Outcome**: If an infeasible action occurs, execution may stop early. Execution failures are categorized into:
     - **Missing Steps**: Necessary actions that were omitted.
     - **Additional Steps**: Unnecessary actions that were included.
     - **Wrong Temporal Order**: Actions executed in an incorrect sequence.
     - **Affordance Errors**: Actions incompatible with the current state of objects (e.g., trying to "open" an object that cannot be opened).

2. **Goal Evaluation**:
   - **Purpose**: To assess if the task goal $g$ is satisfied after executing $\bar{a}$.
   - **Process**: Check for goal satisfaction, e.g. `behavior_eval.evolving_graph.evolving_graph.check_success`.
   - **Partial Goal Satisfaction Evaluation**:
     - Measures the percentage of subgoals in $g$ that are satisfied by $\bar{a}$.
     - **Process**:
       - Decompose $g$ into simple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) goals $g_i$.
       - For each $g_i$:
         - Let $g_i = a₁ \overset{\text{then}}{\ldots} aₖ \textbf{~then~} (p₁ \land \ldots \land p_\ell)$.
         - Check if a subsequence in $\bar{a}$ matches $\{a_j\}_{j=1}^k$.
         - Evaluate the final state propositions $p_j$ in $s_m$.
       - Assign partial credits based on the number of propositions satisfied.
     - **Final Metric**: $\textit{PartialSucc}(\bar{a}, g) = \max_{g_i \in \mathcal{G}(g, \mathcal{U})} \textit{PartialSucc}(\bar{a}, g_i)$.

### Metrics

The evaluation metrics are divided into two categories:

1. **Trajectory Metrics**:
   - **Execution Success Rate**: The proportion of actions in $\bar{a}$ executed successfully without errors.
   - **Error Rates**:
     - **Parsing Errors**: Issues in interpreting the action sequence.
     - **Hallucination Errors**: Actions involving objects or states not present in the environment.
     - **Argument Errors**: Incorrect arguments provided for actions.
     - **Missing Steps**: Rate of necessary actions that were omitted.
     - **Additional Steps**: Rate of unnecessary actions included.
     - **Wrong Temporal Order**: Rate of actions executed in an incorrect sequence.
     - **Affordance Errors**: Rate of actions that cannot be performed due to object states.

2. **Goal Metrics**:
   - **Task Success Rate**: The proportion of tasks where the goal $g$ is fully satisfied after executing $\bar{a}$.
   - **Partial Goal Satisfaction Evaluation**:
        - **State Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying state-based goals (e.g., object states).
        - **Relation Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying relation-based goals (e.g., object relationships).
        - **Action Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for achieving the specified action sequence.
        - **Total Goal Satisfaction**: Overall goal achievement rate, combining state, relation, and action goals.

### Output

The evaluation process produces several outputs:

- **Execution Information**:
  - Details for each action in $\bar{a}$, indicating whether it was executed successfully.
  - Error types encountered during execution (if any).
  - Step-by-step execution status.

- **Goal Satisfaction Results**:
  - Metrics indicating whether the goal was fully or partially satisfied.
  - Counts of total and satisfied predicates, including:
    - **Total Predicates**: Number of conditions evaluated.
    - **Satisfied Predicates**: Number of conditions that were satisfied.
    - Breakdown into edge and node predicates.

- **Overall Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Goal Evaluation**:
    - **Task Success Rate**: Overall success rate for completing the task.
    - **State Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying state-based goals.
    - **Relation Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for satisfying relation-based goals.
    - **Action Goal Satisfaction**: Success rate for achieving the specified action sequence.
    - **Total Goal Satisfaction**: Combined success rate across all goal types.
  - **Trajectory Evaluation**:
    - **Execution Success Rate**: Overall success rate of the action sequence execution.
    - **Grammar Errors**: Rates of parsing, hallucination, and predicate argument number errors.
    - **Runtime Errors**: Rates of wrong order, missing step, affordance, and additional step errors.
