# Embodied Agent Interface

Welcome! **Embodied Agent Interface** is a single-line evaluation pipeline to evaluate LLMs for embodied agents, addressing key challenges in building embodied decision-making agents:

- Standardization of goal specifications.
- Standardization of modules and interfaces.
- Broad coverage of evaluation and fine-grained metrics.

The code is [hosted on GitHub here](https://github.com/embodied-agent-eval/embodied-agent-interface).
