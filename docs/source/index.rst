Embodied Agent Interface
========================

A Single Line to Evaluate LLMs for Embodied Decision Making
------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome! ``Embodied Agent Interface`` is a single-line evaluation
pipeline to evaluate LLMs for embodied decision making. The aim is to tackle the
following challenges in building LLM-based embodied agents:

- Standardization of goal specifications.
- Standardization of modules and interfaces.
- Broad coverage of evaluation and fine-grained metrics.

The code is `hosted on GitHub here <https://github.com/embodied-agent-interface/embodied-agent-interface>`__.
