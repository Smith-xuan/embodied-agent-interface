Here is an in-depth explanation of each action:\n\n1. **put_inside action**:\n   - **Parameters**: Takes a character, an object to place, and a container object.\n   - **Precondition**: The character must be holding the object, the object must be grabbable, the container must be a container, and the character must be next to the container.\n   - **Effect**: The object gets placed inside the container, and the character releases the object.\n\n2. **open action**:\n   - **Parameters**: Takes a character and an object.\n   - **Precondition**: The object must be openable, it must be currently closed, and the character must be next to the object.\n   - **Effect**: The object becomes open and is no longer closed.\n\n3. **grab action**:\n   - **Parameters**: Takes a character and an object.\n   - **Precondition**: The object must be grabbable, and the character must be next to the object.\n   - **Effect**: The character holds the object in their right hand and is no longer next to the object.\n\n4. **walk_towards action**:\n   - **Parameters**: Takes a character and an object.\n   - **Precondition**: The character must be inside a space.\n   - **Effect**: The character is now next to the object and not inside a space.\n\nThis structure maintains consistency with the example provided and uses the defined predicates and types exactly as they appear in the domain file."

The effect of the action should be that the character is now next to the object.\n\nThe precondition for `walk_towards` would be:\n1. The character is not already next to the object.\n2. The object must be movable (since it's a cat).\n3. The character is in some kind of room/container.\n\nThe effect would include:\n1. Indicating that the character is next to the object.\n2. Possibly updating the character's location to reflect that they moved closer to the object.\n\nCombining these thoughts:\n\nHere are the full specifications for the `walk_towards` action:\n```pddl\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (not (next_to ?char ?obj))  ; Character is not already next to the object\n                   (movable ?obj)              ; Object (cat) must be movable\n                   (inside ?char ?room)        ; Character must be inside a room/container\n                   (obj_inside ?obj ?room)     ; Object must be inside the same room/container\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)              ; Character is now next to the object\n           )\n)\n```\n\nCombining everything together, the output should be in JSON format, so here's the final JSON formatted output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (not (next_to ?char ?obj))  ; Character is not already next to the object\\n                   (movable ?obj)              ; Object (cat) must be movable\\n                   (inside ?char ?room)        ; Character must be inside a room/container\\n                   (obj_inside ?obj ?room)     ; Object must be inside the same room/container\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)              ; Character is now next to the object\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the `walk_towards` action is correctly defined with appropriate preconditions and effects for the given problem file in the domain of `virtualhome`."
