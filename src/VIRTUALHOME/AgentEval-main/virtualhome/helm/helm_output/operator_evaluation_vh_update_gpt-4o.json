Effects:\n    - After the action, the character will be next to the object.\n    - Since the action is walking towards something, there might not be direct effects related to other states, but we ensure the new spatial relationship is represented.\n\nGiven these considerations, here is the PDDL action for \"walk_towards\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                     (movable ?char)\\n                     (movable ?obj)\\n                     (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n              (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Action Name and Parameters**:\n    - `walk_towards` is the action name.\n    - Parameters are defined as `?char` (character type) and `?obj` (object type).\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n    - `(movable ?char)`: The character must be movable.\n    - `(movable ?obj)`: The object must be movable.\n    - `(not (next_to ?char ?obj))`: The character should not already be next to the object.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n    - `(next_to ?char ?obj)`: After performing the action, the character will be next to the object.\n\nThis includes understanding the complete format and actions as per your requirements from the domain and problem files you shared."

Analyze the goal state and initial conditions:\n   - The character needs to end up next to the cat.\n   - The character starts inside the bedroom, and the cat is inside the home office.\n\n2. Use the predicates defined in the domain file to form the preconditions and effects:\n   - The action's main objective seems to be moving the character towards the cat until they are next to each other. \n   \n3. Define preconditions:\n   - The character must be in a location different from where the cat is, indicating they need to move.\n   - Optionally, ensuring they are in traversal capability (since the character is movable).\n\n4. Define effects:\n   - The character will now be next to the cat.\n   - The character is no longer just inside the initial bedroom location; they are eventually placed next to the cat.\n\nCombining these pieces, we can complete the `walk_towards` action definition in PDDL format considering movement toward an object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n    (obj_inside ?obj home_office)  ; initial state indicating cat in home office\\n    (inside ?char bedroom)  ; initial state indicating character in bedroom\\n    (not (next_to ?char ?obj))  ; character is not already next to the cat\\n  )\\n  :effect (and\\n    (next_to ?char ?obj)  ; character is now next to the cat\\n    (not (inside ?char bedroom))  ; character moved, no longer just inside bedroom\\n    )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nBreaking down the written action:\n- **Parameters**: both the character (`?char`) and the object (`?obj`) are specified.\n- **Precondition**:\n  - `obj_inside ?obj home_office`: reinforces the initial position of the cat.\n  - `inside ?char bedroom`: initial position of the character.\n  - `not (next_to ?char ?obj)`: confirms the character is not yet next to the cat.\n- **Effect**:\n  - `next_to ?char ?obj`: post-action goal, the character is now next to the cat.\n  - `not (inside ?char bedroom)`: ensures the character has moved out of the bedroom.\n\nThis PDDL configuration maintains logical consistency with the problem definition and the domain rules."

Be next to the object.\n2. The object must be grabbable.\n\nThe effects of this action are:\n1. The character will hold the object in the right hand.\n2. The object will no longer be grabbable since it\u2019s being held.\n\n### Action `walk_towards`\nTo walk towards an object, a character must:\n1. Be in the same room as the object.\n\nThe effects of this action are:\n1. The character will be next to the object.\n2. The character will no longer be inside the room but rather next to the object.\n\nNow, we can write the PDDL for these actions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action grab\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (grabbable ?obj)\\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (holds_rh ?char ?obj)\\n             (not (grabbable ?obj))\\n           )\\n)\\n(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (inside_room ?char ?room)\\n                   (inside_room ?obj ?room)\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n             (not (inside ?char ?room))\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- For `grab` action, the preconditions ensure that the object is grabbable and the character is next to the object. The effects are that the character will hold the object and the object becomes non-grabbable.\n- For `walk_towards` action, the preconditions ensure that both the character and the object are in the same room. The effects are that the character ends up next to the object and is no longer marked as inside the room.\n\nThese encapsulate the logical steps needed for a character to grab an object and walk towards an object within the virtualhome domain."

        "llm_output": "Here's how the actions `grab` and `walk_towards` can be defined in PDDL format given the provided information:\n\n- Action `grab` involves picking up an object. The preconditions include the object being grabbable and the character being close to it. The effects would usually include the character holding the object and possibly no longer next to the object (if we consider that grabbing may imply moving away slightly).\n- Action `walk_towards` involves a character moving towards an object. The preconditions would generally be that the character is not already next to the object. The main effect is that the character is next to the object.\n\nLet's proceed with the complete action definitions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action grab\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                (grabbable ?obj)\n                (next_to ?char ?obj)\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (holds_rh ?char ?obj)\n           (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\n           )\n)\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\n                (movable ?obj)\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (next_to ?char ?obj)\n           )\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- For the `grab` action, we check if the object is grabbable and if the character is next to it. The effects are that the character holds the object with their right hand, and the character is no longer next to the object.\n- For the `walk_towards` action, we ensure the character is not already next to the object and that the object is movable. The effect is that the character will end up next to the object."

We'll need to ensure the room in which the object is located is the same as the room the character is inside.\n\n2. **Effects:**\n    - The character will be next to the object after walking towards it.\n    - The character will no longer be inside the initial room but will now be considered next to the object.\n\nGiven these considerations, we can use the predicates as described in the domain:\n\n### Preconditions\n- `(inside ?char ?room)` : the character must be inside a room.\n- `(inside_room ?obj ?room)` : the object must be inside the same room.\n\n### Effects\n- `(next_to ?char ?obj)` : the character is next to the object.\n- `(not (inside ?char ?room))` : the character is no longer inside the initial room.\n\nWith this understanding, we can write the action as follows:\n\n### Action: `walk_towards`\n```lisp\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object ?room - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (inside ?char ?room)\n                   (inside_room ?obj ?room)\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)\n             (not (inside ?char ?room))\n           )\n)\n```\n\nFinally, concatenating all actions and returning the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object ?room - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (inside ?char ?room)\\n                   (inside_room ?obj ?room)\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n             (not (inside ?char ?room))\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```"

        "llm_output": "Here's the required PDDL action definition for the given \"walk_towards\" action, fully defined according to the provided problem file, domain file predicates, and logical structure guidelines:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (or\\n                   (and\\n                     (inside ?char bedroom)\\n                     (next_to ?char shower)\\n                   )\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Parameters:** The action `walk_towards` involves a character (`?char`) and an object (`?obj`).\n2. **Precondition:** According to the problem definition:\n   - We have `(inside ?char bedroom)` initially.\n   - We need the character to end up `next to` the shower, therefore the basic condition is already given. Hence, the precondition must be such that the character is capable of moving.\n3. **Effect:** The primary effect of the action is that the character `?char` will end up `next to` the object `?obj` (in this case, the shower).\n\nCombining these elements, we generate the full action definition as shown in the output JSON."
