To achieve this, the character needs to:\n1. Walk towards the floor lamp.\n2. Plug in the floor lamp.\n3. Switch on the floor lamp.\n\nLet's define the PDDL actions `plug_in`, `walk_towards`, and `switch_on`.\n\n### Action `plug_in`\nFor the character to plug_in the floor lamp:\n- Preconditions: \n  1. The object (floor lamp) should have a plug.\n  2. The character should be next to the object.\n- Effects: \n  1. The object becomes plugged in.\n  2. It is no longer plugged out.\n\n### Action `walk_towards`\nFor the character to walk towards the floor lamp:\n- Preconditions: \n  1. The character needs to be inside some room.\n  2. The object (floor lamp) should be in some room.\n- Effects: \n  1. The character will be next to the object.\n  2. The character will no longer be inside the original room but inside the room where the object is located.\n\n### Action `switch_on`\nFor the character to switch on the floor lamp:\n- Preconditions: \n  1. The object (floor lamp) should be plugged in.\n  2. The object should have a switch.\n  3. The character should be next to the object.\n  4. The object should be off.\n- Effects: \n  1.

The `plug_in` and `switch_on` actions ensure the floor lamp is plugged in and turned on respectively. These actions, when executed sequentially, help in reaching the goal where the `floor_lamp` is turned on."

The object should have a switch.\n  2. The character should be next to the object to interact with the switch.\n  3. The object should be in the same room as the character.\n  4.

The initial state in the problem file states that the character is inside the `bathroom`, and the goal is to make sure the `light` is `on` and `plugged_in`, which it already is in the initial conditions.\n\nHere\u2019s the combined PDDL for both actions in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\\n  :effect (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n)\\n(:action switch_on\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (has_switch ?obj)\\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n                   (inside_room ?obj bathroom)\\n                   (off ?obj)\\n                )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (on ?obj)\\n             (not (off ?obj))\\n          )\\n)\"\n}\n```\nThis ensures that the specified actions transform the initial state to achieve the goal state as required."

The character must be next to it to perform the action.\n  \n- The **`walk_towards`** action ensures that the character moves next to the object. Since the character is already specified to be inside the \"bedroom\" and all relevant objects are inside \"home_office,\" simplifying the character's movement conditions here to `inside_room ?char bedroom`.\n\n- The **`switch_on`** action requires the object to have a switch and should be in the \"off\" state initially. The character also needs to be next to the object to switch it on.\n\nThese actions collectively ensure that the goal of turning on the computer (`on computer`) can be achieved starting from the initial conditions."

To plug in any electronic device, it must have a plug, and the character must be next to the object.\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - The object must have a plug.\n     - The character must be next to the object.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - The object will be plugged in.\n     - The object will no longer be plugged out.\n\n2. **walk_towards**: This action represents the character walking towards an object.\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - No specific preconditions are needed; it's simply an action to change the state.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - The character will be next to the specified object.\n\n3. **switch_on**: This action will switch on an object. For a switchable object to be turned on, it should have a switch, be in an off state, and be plugged in. The character must also be next to the object.\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - The object should have a switch.\n     - The object should be in an off state.\n     - The object should be plugged in.\n     - The character should be next to the object.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - The object will be on.\n     - The object will no longer be off.\n\nGiven these actions and their logic, below is the complete PDDL string for the `plug_in`, `walk_towards`, and `switch_on` actions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action plug_in\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (has_plug ?obj)\\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (plugged_in ?obj)\\n             (not (plugged_out ?obj))\\n           )\\n)\\n(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition ()\\n  :effect (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n)\\n(:action switch_on\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (has_switch ?obj)\\n                   (off ?obj)\\n                   (plugged_in ?obj)\\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (on ?obj)\\n             (not (off ?obj))\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis combined output will ensure the state transitions from the initial conditions to the goal condition where the computer is turned on. The sequence of actions to achieve this goal would include:\n1. Walk towards the computer.\n2. Plug in the computer.\n3. Switch on the computer.\n\nThese actions cover all necessary transitions: moving to the computer, ensuring it is plugged in, and finally turning it on."

The object is no longer held, and it is on the destination.\n  \n- **walk_towards**: Character moves towards the object from the home office to the dining room. This simplifies the navigation assuming character is initially in the home office.\n  \n- **switch_on**: Character switches on the object (e.g., dishwasher). Precondition is that the object has a switch, is currently off, and the character is next to it. The effect is that the object is now on.\n  \n- **grab**: Character grabs the grabbable object which is next to them.\n\n- **open**: Character opens the object (e.g., dishwasher). Precondition is that the object is closed, can be opened, and the character is next to it. The effect is that the object is now open.\n  \n- **close**: Character closes the object. Precondition is that the object is open and the character is next to it. The effect is that the object is now closed.\n  \n- **plug_in**: Character plugs in the object (e.g., dishwasher). Precondition is that the object is currently unplugged, and the character is next to it. The effect is that the object is now plugged in.\n\nThis set of actions, when executed in the appropriate order, will help transition the initial state to the goal state where the dishwasher is closed, on, and has the dish_soap, cup, and plate on top."

Let's start by analyzing each action and writing the appropriate preconditions and effects.\n\n### Action: grab\nThe `grab` action involves a character grabbing an object. Given the predicates, this action has the following requirements:\n1. The object being grabbed must be grabbable.\n2. The character must be next to the object to grab it.\n\nWhen a character grabs an object, the object can be held by either the right or left hand. For this problem, we don't specify which hand explicitly since the goal states the object needs to be held in the left hand, so we simplify that to holding it with any hand initially and adjusting as needed.\n\n#### Preconditions\n- The object must be grabbable.\n- The character must be next to the object.\n\n#### Effects\n- The character will hold the object in the left hand (as per the goal condition, we can focus directly on the left hand).\n\n```\n(:action grab\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (grabbable ?obj)\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj)\n                )\n  :effect (holds_lh ?char ?obj)\n)\n```\n\n### Action: walk_towards\nThe `walk_towards` action involves a character walking towards an object or location. This action is generally straightforward, with its main purpose being to change the spatial relationship between the character and objects.\n\n#### Preconditions\n- There are no specific preconditions needed for the action of walking towards an object, other than the fact that the action itself implies movement toward the target object.\n\n#### Effects\n- The character will be next to the target object after the action.\n\n```\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect (next_to ?char ?obj)\n)\n```\n\nBy defining these actions, we ensure that we can achieve the final goal state from the given initial conditions.

The remaining task is to switch it on.\n\nHere is the PDDL formatted action descriptions:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition ()\\n  :effect ()\\n)\\n(:action switch_on\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                  (off ?obj)\\n                  (has_switch ?obj)\\n                )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (not (off ?obj))\\n             (on ?obj)\\n           )\\n)\"}\n```\n\n1. The `walk_towards` action definition:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action walk_towards\n     :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n     :precondition ()\n     :effect ()\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. The `switch_on` action definition:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action switch_on\n     :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n     :precondition (and\n                     (off ?obj)\n                     (has_switch ?obj)\n                   )\n     :effect (and\n               (not (off ?obj))\n               (on ?obj)\n             )\n   )\n   ```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `walk_towards` requires no specific precondition or effect, as a character can walk towards any object without needing any specific state predicates.\n- `switch_on` requires the object to be `off` and have a `switch`. The effect is to remove the `off` state and add the `on` state to the object, which satisfies part of the goal conditions.\n\nThe combined output ensures that the character can perform actions in the given order to achieve the goal state from the initial state."

Here are the definitions:\n\n1. `walk_towards`: This action enables the character to walk towards an object (e.g., from the dining_room to the home_office where the stereo is located).\n\n2. `switch_on`: This action switches on an object. Here, it will be used for switching on the stereo.\n\n### The `walk_towards` Action\n\nThis action doesn't have preconditions or effects specified directly in the problem. However, we can infer that the character must be inside a location (in this case, `dining_room`). After performing the action, the character should be inside the room where the object is. Let's assume `walk_towards` implies changing the room of the character.\n\n```pddl\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (exists (?room1 - object)\n                   (and\n                     (inside ?char ?room1) ; Character must be inside some room\n                     (obj_inside ?obj ?room2) ; Object must be inside some room\n                   )\n                 )\n  :effect (and \n            (exists (?room1 - object)\n              (not (inside ?char ?room1))) ; Character is no longer in the initial room\n            (exists (?room2 - object)\n              (inside ?char ?room2)) ; Character is now inside the room containing the object\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### The `switch_on` Action\n\nTo switch the stereo on, a character needs to interact with it. The stereo must have a switch, and the character should be next to it. After the action, the stereo will be on.\n\n```pddl\n(:action switch_on\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (has_switch ?obj) ; Object must have a switch\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj) ; Character must be next to the object\n                   (off ?obj) ; Object must be off\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n            (on ?obj) ; Object is now on\n            (not (off ?obj)) ; Object is no longer off\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Combined Output\n\nCombining these action definitions into the required output format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (exists (?room1 - object)\\n                   (and\\n                     (inside ?char ?room1) ; Character must be inside some room\\n                     (obj_inside ?obj ?room2) ; Object must be inside some room\\n                   )\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and \\n            (exists (?room1 - object)\\n              (not (inside ?char ?room1))) ; Character is no longer in the initial room\\n            (exists (?room2 - object)\\n              (inside ?char ?room2)) ; Character is now inside the room containing the object\\n          )\\n)\\n\\n(:action switch_on\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (has_switch ?obj) ; Object must have a switch\\n                   (next_to ?char ?obj) ; Character must be next to the object\\n                   (off ?obj) ; Object must be off\\n                 )\\n  :effect (and\\n            (on ?obj) ; Object is now on\\n            (not (off ?obj)) ; Object is no longer off\\n          )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis includes both actions `walk_towards` and `switch_on` with their respective parameters, preconditions, and effects, ensuring the goal can be achieved by executing them in the correct order."

Therefore, I'll create actions that allow the character to walk towards an object and grab it, ensuring these actions help reach the goal.\n\n### Precondition Reasoning:\n- **grab**: The character needs to be next to the object they want to grab.\n- **walk_towards**: There should be no strict preconditions other than indicating the relationship after execution.\n\n### Effect Reasoning:\n- **grab**: After grabbing, the object should be held by the character in the left hand. The state should also reflect that the object is no longer next to the character as it is now held.\n- **walk_towards**: Should establish that the character is now next to the object they walked towards.\n\nHere's the PDDL definition of these actions:\n\n```lisp\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action grab\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n  :effect (and (holds_lh ?char ?obj) (not (next_to ?char ?obj)))\\n)\\n(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition ()\\n  :effect (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThese action definitions should help move from the initial conditions to the goal conditions by allowing a character to approach an object and subsequently grab it.

Since the next_to relationship between couch and television is already in the initial conditions, they both can be used with the couch as the main element.\n  - Effects update the character to be next to the object.\n- **sit**:\n  - Preconditions ensure that the object can be sat on and the character is next to the object.\n  - Effects update the character to be sitting and on top of the object.\n\nCombining these actions, a planning system can execute \"walk_towards\" followed by \"sit\" to reach the goal state of the character sitting on the couch."

This is represented using the `inside` predicate for both the character and the object with an existential quantifier to ensure they are in the same room.\n  - Effect: The character will be next to the object after the action, represented by the `next_to` predicate.\n\n- **sit action**:\n  - Parameters: A character and an object.\n  - Precondition: The character must be next to the object (`next_to` predicate) and the object must be sittable (`sittable` predicate).\n  - Effect: The character will be sitting (`sitting` predicate) and on top of the object (`ontop` predicate) after the action.\n\nThis ensures that after executing `walk_towards` followed by `sit`, the initial conditions can be transformed to meet the goal conditions specified in the problem file."

The character needs to walk towards the object (phone in this case).\n2.

For the action `walk_into`, we need to see how the character transitions between rooms. \n\nHere\u2019s how we can construct the action `walk_into`.\n\n### Action: walk_into\n- **Parameters**: \n  - The character who will walk into a room.\n  - The room the character will walk into.\n\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - The character should exist.\n  - The character should not currently be inside the destination room (this avoids redundancy).\n\n- **Effects**: \n  - The character will be inside the destination room.\n  - The character will no longer be in their current room before walking into the new room.\n\n### Construction of Action:\n1. **Preconditions**: There are no explicitly stated preconditions other than checking the character is not already in the target room.\n2. **Effects**: We need to handle the movement from one room to another by stating that the character will be in the new room and will no longer be in the old room.\n\nLet's put this plan into PDDL format:\n\n```pddl\n(:action walk_into\n  :parameters (?char - character ?room - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (not (inside ?char ?room))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n             (inside ?char ?room)\n             (not (inside ?char home_office))\n          )\n)\n```\n\nThis action ensures that once the character executes the `walk_into` action, they will be inside the targeted room (dining room in this specific problem), and they will not be inside the home office.\n\nTo provide the requested json format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action walk_into\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?room - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                   (not (inside ?char ?room))\\n                )\\n  :effect (and\\n             (inside ?char ?room)\\n             (not (inside ?char home_office))\\n          )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis concludes the necessary PDDL action definition for `walk_into`, ensuring the character can move from the home office to the dining room to achieve the goal state."

This involves:\n1. The character being inside the same room as the shower.\n2. After executing the action, the character should no longer be in the dining room but should be next to the shower.\n\nWe can assume that once the character enters the bathroom, they will be next to the shower since the goal is for them to be next to the shower.\n\n### Action Details\n1. **Action Name**: `walk_towards`\n2. **Parameters**: A character and an object.\n3. **Preconditions**: Character must be inside a room, and the target object must be inside another room.\n4. **Effects**: After the action, the character should be next to the target object and no longer inside the initial room.\n\n### PDDL Action Definition\n\n```json\n{\n    \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                       (inside ?char ?initial_room)\\n                       (inside_room ?obj ?target_room)\\n                   )\\n  :effect (and\\n                 (not (inside ?char ?initial_room))\\n                 (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nHere's the detailed explanation for the action `walk_towards`:\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - The character should be inside a room (`inside ?char ?initial_room`).\n  - The target object should be inside another room (`inside_room ?obj ?target_room`).\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - The character is no longer inside the initial room (`not (inside ?char ?initial_room)`).\n  - The character is now next to the target object (`next_to ?char ?obj`)."

        "llm_output": "Given the problem file and the defined predicates, we need to define the actions needed to achieve the goal state from the initial state. \n\nFirstly, let's analyze the initial state and the goal state provided in the problem file. \n\n- **Initial State:**\n  - (inside character bedroom): The character is inside the bedroom.\n  - (inside_room shower bathroom): The shower is inside the bathroom.\n\n- **Goal State:**\n  - (next_to character shower): The character must be next to the shower.\n\nFrom the initial and goal states, we can infer that the character needs to move from the bedroom to the bathroom to be next to the shower. We can create a walking action to accomplish this.\n\nWhen defining the action `walk_towards`, let's ensure that:\n- The character must be in the same place as the target before the walk towards (precondition).\n- The character needs to end up next to the target (effect).\n\nHere\u2019s how the action would be written in PDDL:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (exists (?room - object)\\n                  (and (inside ?char ?room)\\n                       (inside_room ?obj ?room)))\\n  :effect (and (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n               (forall (?room - object) (when (inside ?char ?room) (not (inside ?char ?room))))))\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Parameters:** The action `walk_towards` takes a character and an object.\n- **Precondition:** \n  - The character and object must be in the same room, i.e., there exists a room such that the character is inside it (`inside ?char ?room`) and the object is inside it (`inside_room ?obj ?room`).\n- **Effect:**\n  - After the action, the character will be next to the object (`next_to character ?obj`).\n  - The character will no longer be inside the previous room (using `forall` and `when` to negate `inside ?char ?room`).\n\nThis action ensures that the character will end up next to the shower, changing the initial state to match the goal state. This concludes our PDDL action definition based on the problem file provided."
