        "llm_output": "Given the problem file, the task is to define the action walk_towards in PDDL format. \n\nBased on the provided predicates and initial conditions in the problem file, we can infer the following preconditions and effects for the walk_towards action:\n\nPreconditions:\n1. The character must be inside a room.\n2. The character should be able to move towards the specified object.\n\nEffects:\n1. The character is now next to the specified object.\n\nPutting this information together, the PDDL action definition for walk_towards would look like:\n\n```lisp\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                   (inside ?char ?room)  ; The character must be inside a room\n                   (movable ?char)        ; The character must be able to move\n                   (obj_next_to ?char ?obj)  ; The character is not yet next to the specified object\n                )\n  :effect (and\n             (next_to ?char ?obj)  ; The character is now next to the specified object\n           )\n)\n```\n\nThis definition captures the conditions under which the character can walk towards a specified object in the virtual home domain."
