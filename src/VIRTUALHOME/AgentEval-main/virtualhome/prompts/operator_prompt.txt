You are a software engineer who will be writing action definitions for a household robot in the PDDL planning language given the problem file and predicates in domain file.

The following is predicates defined in this domain file. Pay attention to the types for each predicate.
(define (domain virtualhome)
(:requirements :typing)
    ;; types in virtualhome domain
    (:types 
        object character  ; Define 'object' and 'character' as types
    )

    ;; Predicates defined on this domain. Note the types for each predicate.
    (:predicates
        (closed ?obj - object)  ; obj is closed
        (open ?obj - object)  ; obj is open
        (on ?obj - object)  ; obj is turned on, or it is activated
        (off ?obj - object)  ; obj is turned off, or it is deactivated
        (plugged_in ?obj - object)  ; obj is plugged in
        (plugged_out ?obj - object)  ; obj is unplugged

Objective: Given the problem file of pddl, which defines objects in the task (:objects), initial conditions (:init) and goal conditions (:goal), write the body of PDDL actions (:precondition and :effect) given specific action names and parameters. 

Each PDDL action definition consists of four main components: action name, parameters, precondition, and effect. Here is the general format to follow:
(:action [action name]
  :parameters ([action parameters])
  :precondition ([action precondition])
  :effect ([action effect]) 
)

The :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. 

The :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))

The :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))

In any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.

Here is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. Observe carefully how to think step by step to write the action body of hang_up_clothes:
Input:
Problem file:
(define (problem hang-clothes-problem)
  (:domain household)
  (:objects
    character - character
    shirt - object
    hanger - object
  ) ; This section declares the instances needed for the problem: character is an instance of a character; shirt is an instance of an object classified as clothes; hanger is an object that is suitable for hanging clothes.
  (:init
    (clothes shirt)
    (hangable hanger)
    (holds_rh alice shirt)
    (next_to alice hanger)
  ) ; This section declares the initial conditions. (clothes shirt) and (hangable hanger) tells the properties of objects; (holds_rh alice shirt) indicates that Alice is holding the shirt in her right hand; (next_to alice hanger) means Alice is next to the hanger, ready to hang the shirt.
  (:goal
    (and
      (ontop shirt hanger)
    )
  ) ; This section declares the goal.  (ontop shirt hanger) is the goal, where the shirt should end up hanging on the hanger.
)
Action to be finished:
(:action hang_up_clothes
  :parameters (?char - character ?clothes - object ?hang_obj - object)
  :precondition ()
  :effect ()
)

Example output: 
Given the objects in the problem file, and what typically needs to be true to perform an action like hanging up clothes: 1. clothes must indeed be a type of clothing. 2. hang_obj should be something on which clothes can be hung (hangable). 3. char should be holding the clothes, either in the right or left hand. 4. char needs to be next to the hanging object to hang the clothes. Besides, we need to write preconditions in Disjunctive Normal Form.
These insights guide us to write:
:precondition (or
                (and
                    (clothes ?clothes)  ; the object must be a piece of clothing
                    (hangable ?hang_obj)  ; the target must be an object suitable for hanging clothes
                    (holds_rh ?char ?clothes)  ; character is holding clothes in the right hand
                    (next_to ?char ?hang_obj)  ; character is next to the hanging object
                )
                (and
                    (clothes ?clothes)  ; the object must be a piece of clothing
                    (hangable ?hang_obj)  ; the target must be an object suitable for hanging clothes
                    (holds_lh ?char ?clothes)  ; character is holding clothes in the left hand
                    (next_to ?char ?hang_obj)  ; character is next to the hanging object
                )
            )
Effects describe how the world state changes due to the action. After hanging up clothes, you'd expect: 1. char is no longer holding the clothes. 2. clothes is now on the hang_obj.
These expectations convert into effects:
:effect (and
             (when (holds_rh ?char ?clothes)(not (holds_rh ?char ?clothes)))  ; if clothes are held in the right hand, they are no longer held
             (when (holds_lh ?char ?clothes)(not (holds_lh ?char ?clothes)))  ; if clothes are held in the left hand, they are no longer held
             (ontop ?clothes ?hang_obj)  ; clothes are now hanging on the object
           )

Combining these parts, the complete hang_up_clothes action becomes:
(:action hang_up_clothes
  :parameters (?char - character ?clothes - object ?hang_obj - object)
  :precondition (or
                   (and
                     (clothes ?clothes)
                     (hangable ?hang_obj)
                     (holds_rh ?char ?clothes)
                     (next_to ?char ?hang_obj)
                   )
                   (and
                     (clothes ?clothes)
                     (hangable ?hang_obj)
                     (holds_lh ?char ?clothes)
                     (next_to ?char ?hang_obj)
                   )
                 )
  :effect (and
             (when (holds_rh ?char ?clothes)(not (holds_rh ?char ?clothes))) 
             (when (holds_lh ?char ?clothes)(not (holds_lh ?char ?clothes))) 
             (ontop ?clothes ?hang_obj) 
           )
)

hint: In many cases WHEN is not necessary. Don't enforce the use of WHEN

Above is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to reason step by step and write the action body in PDDL. 

Here are some other commonly used actions and their PDDL definition:
(:action pick_and_place
    :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object ?dest - object)
    :precondition (and
        (grabbable ?obj)        ; The object must be grabbable
        (surfaces ?dest)        ; The destination must be a surface
        (next_to ?char ?obj)    ; The character must be next to the object
        (not (obj_ontop ?obj ?dest)) ; Ensure the object is not already on the destination
    )
    :effect (and
        (obj_ontop ?obj ?dest)        ; The object is now on the destination
        (next_to ?char ?dest)         ; The character is now next to the destination
    )
)
(:action bow
    :parameters (?char - character ?target - character)
    :precondition (and
        (next_to ?char ?target)  ; The character must be next to the target to perform the bow
    )
    :effect ()
)
Note that it is possible the action has no effect. 

REMEMBER: You MUST only use predicates and object types exactly as they appear in the domain file at the beginning. Now given the input, please fill in the action body for each provided actions in PDDL format. 

Input:
<problem_file>
<action_handlers>
